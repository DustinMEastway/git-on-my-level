# Git On My Level: Bridging Knowledge with Practical Solutions

If you write code, you're likely using Git. If not, you probably should be—unless you enjoy the thrill of losing track of your work and spending hours hunting down bugs. But don’t worry, this talk isn't about convincing you why Git is a must; there are plenty of resources for that. Instead, we’ll address why many developers feel uneasy about performing complex operations with Git. Although there are numerous resources available to learn Git, I believe a major reason for the unease is the traditional method of teaching—introducing one command or term at a time, often without practical examples of how to use them.

In this session, we’ll bridge that gap. We’ll tackle common Git challenges, dive into practical solutions, and dissect the mechanics behind each approach. You'll learn the pros and cons of different strategies and gain actionable insights to resolve frequent issues faced by you and your team during collaboration.

By the end of this session, you'll be equipped with the skills and confidence to handle Git more effectively and improve your development workflow.

## Introduction

Most of this presentation's information was found in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), its problems come from my career, and its solutions come from past tears I have shed.

I will start with quickly running through prerequisite [terminology](#terminology) for 15 minutes for those that have no desire to read a book on Git.

Next, we can use that knowledge to work through [problems & solutions](#problems--solutions) for 35 minutes only introducing [commands](./commands.md) as they are used to solve problems instead of them being the focus.

Finally, I will leave 10 minutes open at the end for questions.
