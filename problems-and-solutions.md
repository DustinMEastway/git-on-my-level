# Problems & Solutions

## Create Git Repository

A Git repository (often called a repo), looks like a normal directory with a `.git` subdirectory in it. How you go about initializing your repository depends on whether you want to base it off from an existing codebase or a local directory.

### Clone An Existing Codebase

Cloning a Git repository from a remote server can be done using the [git clone command](./commands.md#git-clone).

This will create a new directory with the same name as the repository and place the contents in the directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DustinMEastway/git-on-my-level.git
```

### Initialize From A Directory

Creating a Git repostiroy from a local directory (even if it is empty) can be done using the [git init command](./commands.md#git-init).

```bash
git init
```
