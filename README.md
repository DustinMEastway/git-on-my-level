# Git On My Level: Bridging Knowledge with Practical Solutions

I am writing these files in an attempt to teach people more about Git and serve as a reference to come back to if you forget something you learned earlier. Below are some helpful resources that you are likely here for.

- The Git On My Level presentation can be [accessed here in Markdown format](./presentation.md) (comes with "Follow Along" sections for a full Git tutorial) or [in my Google Drive as a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDJSRT9h1cgUJpjj7HjfBCcF0jJc0H-SW1pu3CIG5bc) (prettier to look at).
  - [Click here to see the simplified version of the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jw2sH2fTNquJmsiOZolJ8IAmE3vO1iKFgyzBCbSKGIs/edit?usp=sharing). This is the version assumes you have prior experience with Git and does not provide a step-by-step follow along.
- [Terminology documentation](./terminology.md) should contain all technical terms I use throughout this repository.
- [Commands documentation](./terminology.md) should contain all the Git commands used throughout this repository.
- This repository is intended to be a living document that I improve & add to as time goes on, so please [file a new issue](https://github.com/DustinMEastway/git-on-my-level/issues/new) (or better yet, [create a pull request](https://github.com/DustinMEastway/git-on-my-level/compare)) for any improvements (typos, missing problems to solve, cool features you think I should cover, etc.) you think should be made to this repository.
- [Problems & solutions](./problems-and-solutions.md) is where I drew the original problems to solve from, but it will likely get merged into the same documentation as the [presentation](./presentation.md) when I have time (e.i. never).
