# Git On My Level: Bridging Knowledge with Practical Solutions

I am writing these files in an attempt to teach people more about Git and serve as a reference to come back to if you forget something you learned earlier. Below are some helpful resources that you are likely here for.

- The Git On My Level presentation can be [accessed here in Markdown format](./presentation.md) which I recommend because it comes with "Follow Along" sections for a full (mostly copy/paste) Git tutorial. You can also access it in [my Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BDJSRT9h1cgUJpjj7HjfBCcF0jJc0H-SW1pu3CIG5bc) or [as a PDF](./data/assets/git-on-my-level-presentation.pdf) to see it as a slideshow.
  - I also create a simplified version of the presentation for people that have already used Git (the follow along tutorial does not work here) which is also available in my [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jw2sH2fTNquJmsiOZolJ8IAmE3vO1iKFgyzBCbSKGIs/edit?usp=sharing) or [as a PDF](./data/assets/simplified-git-on-my-level-presentation.pdf).
- [Terminology documentation](./terminology.md) should contain all technical terms I use throughout this repository.
- [Commands documentation](./terminology.md) should contain all the Git commands used throughout this repository.
- This repository is intended to be a living document that I improve & add to as time goes on, so please [file a new issue](https://github.com/DustinMEastway/git-on-my-level/issues/new) (or better yet, [create a pull request](https://github.com/DustinMEastway/git-on-my-level/compare)) for any improvements (typos, missing problems to solve, cool features you think I should cover, etc.) you think should be made to this repository.
- [Problems & solutions](./problems-and-solutions.md) is where I drew the original problems to solve from, but it will likely get merged into the same documentation as the [presentation](./presentation.md) when I have time (e.i. never).
